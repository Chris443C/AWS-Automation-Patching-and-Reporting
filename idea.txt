To combine this SSM script (which audits running services, patch levels, and installed software) with:

AWS Inspector (for vulnerability and CVE detection)

Automated patching that downloads updates but installs only after approval

You can design a hybrid compliance + patching pipeline using AWS-native tools:

üîê HIGH-LEVEL WORKFLOW
Step 1: ‚úÖ Inspector scans for vulnerabilities
Inspector continuously scans the instance (needs to be activated via AWS Console or API).

It reports:

CVEs for missing patches

Severity levels

Package/KB info

Step 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Patch Manager downloads all available patches
Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to scan and download patches without applying them.

This creates an inventory of what's available (but not yet installed).

Step 3: üìã Run audit script (your current SSM PowerShell script)
Collect:

Running services

Currently installed updates

Installed software

Save to S3 for analysis

Step 4: üõ°Ô∏è Approval workflow (manual or automated)
Use AWS Systems Manager Change Manager (or your own system) to approve/reject installation of specific patches.

Or store approved-KB-list.json in S3, and have a script check against it.

Step 5: üöÄ Install only approved patches
Run AWS-RunPatchBaseline with Install mode and a custom baseline limited to approved patches.

üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
‚úÖ 1. Enable AWS Inspector (v2)
Go to Inspector ‚Üí Enable for your account/region.

Ensure EC2 instances are tagged or selected for scanning.

It auto-integrates with Patch Manager and Security Hub.

‚úÖ 2. Patch Manager (Download-Only Mode)
Create a custom State Manager association with:

Document: AWS-RunPatchBaseline

Parameters:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Operation": ["Scan"]
}
This will:

Check for applicable patches

Download them only (but not install)

Update patch compliance data

‚úÖ 3. Run your Inventory Script
This is the PowerShell script you already have:

Lists services, installed updates, software

Outputs to S3

Can be run on demand or scheduled (via State Manager or Lambda)

‚úÖ 4. Manual or Automated Approval
Option A: Manual approval

Review S3 report or Inspector findings

Manually update a JSON list of approved KBs or patch IDs

Option B: Automated approval system

Lambda function reads Inspector findings

Auto-approves only patches with CVSS ‚â• 8.0

Updates your patch baseline via API

‚úÖ 5. Apply Only Approved Patches
Use a custom Patch Baseline with approved KBs or classifications.

Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
AWS-RunPatchBaseline
With:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Operation": ["Install"]
}
Or limit by baseline IDs and tags.

üß† Example: Approval Workflow
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "ApprovedPatches": [
    "KB5034122",
    "KB5034237"
  ],
  "ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel": "CRITICAL"
}
This list can be stored in:

Patch Baseline

Parameter Store

S3 file (loaded in your patching script)

üìä Optional: Visual Reporting
Use QuickSight or Athena + S3 to correlate:

Installed updates

Missing patches

Approved patches

Inspector vulnerabilities

üîÑ Automation Summary
Tool	Function
Inspector	Detect CVEs and patch-related risks
Patch Manager (Scan mode)	Download but not install patches
Your Script	Audit services, updates, software (SSM)
Change Manager / Custom Workflow	Approve patches
Patch Manager (Install mode)	Install only approved patches
